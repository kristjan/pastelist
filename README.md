# PasteList

PasteList lets you drop in any list of songs and quickly generate a playlist.
It simply searches for each line of your text and pulls the first track Spotify
finds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo into `~/Spotify/pastelist` (On OSX)
2. Launch Spotify and search for `spotify:app:pastelist`

If you have trouble, peruse:

* [Spotify - Developers](http://developer.spotify.com/)
* [The App-building tutorial](http://developer.spotify.com/download/spotify-apps-api/tutorial/)

## Future work:

* Parallel searches while maintaining track order
* Per-song selection when there are multiple results
